\begin{abstract}
The goal of this project is to implement a Next Generation Sequencing Pipeline with Apache Spark. This is a pipeline which processes human genomes in order to detect and annotate Variants which in literature are known as deleterious. These kind of pipeline are much time and resource consuming, so has been introduced Apache Spark, a Big Data technology which can introduce efficiency in the work load. With Spark there is the possibility to deploy this pipeline over a computer-cluster, so through Docker I delivered the necessary technologies to execute it in cluster-mode on Microsoft Azure VMs.
